# xc-similarity

Tools to calculate similarity between documents

## Quickstart

Build the XMLSimilar tool (requires installation of CMake):

```bash
$ cmake CMakeLists.txt
$ make
```

This builds an executable in `bin/Release/XMLSimilar`.

To use: 
`XMLSimilar <from> <to>`, where `<from>` is the path to a 'from' XML document and 'to' is a path to a 'to' document. For example:

```bash
xc-similarity{py37}$ bin/Release/XMLSimilar ~/Desktop/BILLS-116hr1500ih.xml ~/Desktop/BILLS-116hr1500rh.xml
<To> document containing 84% of <From> document.
<From> document containing 84% of <To> document.
```
