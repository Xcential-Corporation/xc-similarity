# xc-similarity

Tools to calculate similarity between documents

## Quickstart

Build the XMLSimilar tool (requires installation of CMake):

```bash
$ cmake CMakeLists.txt
$ make
```

This builds an executable in `bin/Release/XMLSimilar`.

To use: 
`XMLSimilar <from> <to>`, where `<from>` is the path to a 'from' XML document and 'to' is a path to a 'to' document. For example:

```bash
xc-similarity{py37}$ bin/Release/XMLSimilar ~/Desktop/BILLS-116hr1500ih.xml ~/Desktop/BILLS-116hr1500rh.xml
{
    "from_ngram_num": 5946,
    "to_ngram_num": 5914,
    "intersection_num": 5021,
    "from_match_percent": 84,
    "to_match_percent": 84
}
```
